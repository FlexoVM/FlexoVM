**Why is your organization applying to participate in Google Summer of Code 2014? What do you hope to gain by participating?***

We're a young open-source project and with GSoC we would like to kickstart the community contributions. We have several challenging student project ideas that we believe would be of interest and which would also be extremely beneficial to the RoboVM project. E.g. during 2014 we would like to to add support for the new Java 8 lambda language feature to RoboVM and port over the new APIs introduced in Java 8 from the OpenJDK project. These are additions that would benefit the RoboVM open-source project immensely.

**How many potential mentors do you have for this year's program? What criteria did you use to select them?***

So far we have one mentor for this year's program. Niklas is the founder of the RoboVM open-source project, knows it inside out and works on it full-time. We also have one backup mentor which will step in and keep things running in the unlikely event that something should happen to Niklas.

When selecting mentors we are looking for developers who have shown an ongoing interest in the project and who have made significant contributions to it in. Furthermore, mentors should know their way around the RoboVM source code and the build system.

**What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?***

Detailed contact information will be required from all participating students. Students will be required to report back to their mentor at least once a week. We will encourage frequent code pushes to ensure that no work is lost should the student disappear indefinitely. We will also require that the work is documented continuously to make it easy for someone else to pick up the work if the student should disappear. We will make it clear from the start that disappearing students will not pass the midterm or final evaluation.

**What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?***

The mentor will be required to report to the backup once a week. As much as possible of the student-mentor communication will be carried out in public channels to make it easier for the backup to follow the progress of the work and be kept up to date.

**What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before and during the program?***

Applying students will be required to make some small code contribution, fixing a bug or implementing a small new feature, as part of the application process. This should get them somewhat familiar with the code and make them interact with the community even before the program starts.

The weekly student-mentor reports will be published on our wiki for the community to comment. Less formal student-mentor interaction will be carried out in public channels as much as possible (IRC, the RoboVM Google Group, etc) to engage the community. The student will be granted access to the code repository and will be encouraged to push code often so that the community can follow the progress of the work and comment.

**What will you do to encourage your accepted students to stick with the project after Google Summer of Code concludes?***

We will try to make the students feel part of the community and as equal developers, rather than students on summer job. Each student will have write access to the source code repository and we will not revoke this access if they continue to show some interest in the project after the program ends.

All of our project ideas are features that would be very beneficial to the RoboVM project and when finished they will go straight into the product. Seeing your work actually being used, we believe, is a great incentive for a student to stick with the project and contribute in the future.
